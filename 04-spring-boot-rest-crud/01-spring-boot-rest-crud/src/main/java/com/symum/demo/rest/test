 --> JAVA JSON Data Binding
    -> Data binding is actually converting JSON data to a java pojo.
    -> Spring uses the jackson project behind the scene for handling the data between
       JSON and java pojo.
    -> By default jackson will call the appropriate getter or setter method.

 --> @PostConstruct
    -> The @PostConstruct annotation is used in Java EE (Enterprise Edition) and Spring Framework to
       specify a method that should be executed immediately after a bean has been instantiated, and
       before any other methods are called or any dependencies are injected. It is typically used for
       initialization tasks that need to be performed after the bean is created.
 --> @PathVariable
    -> The @PathVariable annotation is used in Spring Framework (particularly in Spring MVC) to extract
       values from the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) template and bind them to method parameters in
       a Spring MVC controller. This annotation is often used when building RESTful web services or
       handling URL patterns with dynamic segments.

       @Controller
       @RequestMapping("/example")
       public class MyController {

           @GetMapping("/user/{id}")
           @ResponseBody
           public String getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
               // The {id} segment from the URL will be bound to the 'id' parameter.
               return "User ID: " + id;
           }
       }
       ** Here the variable and method param should match.
