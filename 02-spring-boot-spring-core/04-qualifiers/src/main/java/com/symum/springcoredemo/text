  --> @Qualifier
       -> When there is more bean then one the spring will not initialize as bean does not know which one
          to call, so by @Qualifier annotation we can determine the individual bean to start.
       -> It can be called by (@Qualifier("cricketCoach")), here the name should be the exact class name.
  --> @Primary
       -> If we uses @Primary annotation we do not have to use @Qualifier annotation any more.
       -> When using @Primary, can have only one for multiple implementations.
       -> If you mark multiple classes with @Primary we will see "Unsatisfied
          dependency expressed through constructor".
       -> Among @Primary and @Qualifier, @Qualifier has the higher priority.
       -> @Primary leaves it up to the implementation classes and leads to an error for using multiple,
          whereas @Qualifier allows to be very specific on which bean you will implement.
